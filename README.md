This repository contains projects I made during 8-month Data Scientist courses by Yandex. 

Please note that initially the descriptions for the projects were made in Russian for the convenience of reviewers. Therefore, don't be surprised if you see some sentences in Russian. However, I hope this does not make it difficult for you to understand the solutions I proposed.
